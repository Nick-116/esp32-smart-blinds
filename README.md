# esp32-smart-blinds
the ESP32 Smart Blinds project started becuase I wanted a way to open and close my blinds using Home Assistant, that was reliable and powerful. My blinds are very large (72 inch x 2 inch slats) so I needed a powerful motor. This design works with many different sizes of motors, anywhere from nema 8 steppers all the way to geared nema17s.

This project is in development. When the project is finished, I will post all STLs and pcb designs here

## Cost
Altogether this project costs around $20 per blind but depending on the motor you use and where you get it from, it can be much cheaper. I use a nema 17 1:5 geared stepper motor, which works well for my medium sized blinds, and will work good in most cases. This costs around $10 on aliexpress. If you have lighter blinds you can get a normal nema 17 stepper, which costs around $5 on aliexpress, or $10 on amazon.
